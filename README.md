# IIB Project

- Course: [MEng in Engineering](http://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/node/339) at the University of Cambridge
- Subject: Multi-output neural processes
- Supervisor: [Professor Richard Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26)

## Aims of the project

1. Build a conditional neural process (CNP) for handling multi-output data and deploy on both synthetic and real-world data.
2. Understand which architectures are good for deploying CNPs on multi-output data, both on the input and output side.
3. Establish benchmarks for testing and evaluating CNPs for multi-output data, including health and environmental science datasets.

## Background to the project

Deep learning methods have enjoyed enourmous success in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks.
